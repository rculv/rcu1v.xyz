## My Portfolio Website | rcu1v.xyz
##
I wanted this website to have one idea in mind, hosting my portfolio without all the stupid extra stuff. I wanted a simple, not too generic portfolio that someone could see and understand my skillset.
I couldn't find a website builder I liked using, so I used HTML, CSS and Javascript along with ChatGPT for polishing. The website, except for certain formatting things, were written by me in Notepad++.
I have published the code for this website here on this repo.
